# :star: Advent of Code 2021

Haskell solutions for Advent Of Code 2021

## Tools

In order to start a new day of Advent of Code and not be copying and pasting the same code skeleton
every time I progress (it was okay until time 5) I created some templates and a bash script.

The script can be executed passing the Advent of Code year and day number as follows:

```bash
  tools/template.sh 2021 6  
```
